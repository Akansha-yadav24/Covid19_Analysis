# Covid19 Analysis

This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights regarding the pandemic. Using a combination of data analysis and visualization techniques, the project explores various aspects such as case numbers, vaccination rates, and more, to help provide a deeper understanding of the global impact of COVID-19.

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- **Plotly**: 
  - `import plotly.graph_objs as go`  
  - `import plotly.io as pio`  
  - `import plotly.express as px`  
  Plotly is used for creating interactive data visualizations and graphs.

- **Pandas**:  
  - `import pandas as pd`  
  Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, including data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

- **Matplotlib**:  
  - `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`  
  Matplotlib is used for creating static visualizations, including various types of plots and charts.

- **Plotly Offline**:  
  - `import plotly.offline as py`  
  Plotly Offline is used to create interactive visualizations in a notebook environment without requiring an internet connection. It is initialized with `py.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)`.

- **Plotly Renderers**:  
  - `pio.renderers.default = 'colab'`  
  Configures Plotly to render graphs in Colab notebooks.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install plotly pandas matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Covid19_Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Covid19_Analysis
   ```

3. Ensure your environment is set up with all dependencies.

   This will process the COVID-19 dataset and generate interactive visualizations and reports.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project typically contains information about COVID-19 cases, including total cases, deaths, recoveries, testing rates, and vaccination rates. It may also include data by country, region, or state. You can find the dataset [here](link-to-dataset) or use publicly available COVID-19 datasets like those from [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

## Data Analysis

The project includes various analyses, such as:

- **Case Trends**: Analyzing how cases of COVID-19 have evolved over time in different regions.
- **Comparing Regions**: Comparing the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries across countries or states.
- **Vaccination Trends**: Tracking vaccination rates and how they correlate with case numbers.

## Data Visualization

The visualizations generated in this project include interactive plots and charts, such as:

- **Line charts** showing case trends over time.
- **Bar charts** comparing cases or vaccination rates across different regions.
- **Scatter plots** illustrating the relationship between different variables (e.g., vaccination rates vs. case numbers).
